#Analyse Flight Delays 

Problem Statement: “FlightDelays.csv” is a dataset given here. It shows that there have been 2201 airplane flights in January 2004, flying from the Washington DC area into the NYC area.
What’s interesting to note is that the main characteristic of interest (the response) is if a flight has been delayed by more than 15 min (coded as 0 for no delay, and 1 for delay) or not.
The explanatory variables include three different arrival airports—John F Kennedy, Newark, and LaGuardia. 
The three different departure airports are Reagan, Dulles, and Baltimore, along with eight carriers, and a categorical variable for 16 different hours of departure (6 am to 10 pm).
The other variables include weather conditions (0 = good/1 = bad) and day of the week (1 for Sunday and Monday and 0 for all other days).
Analyse to identify the flights that are likely to be delayed.
